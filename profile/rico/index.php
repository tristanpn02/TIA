            <h3>Description</h3>
            <h5>Rico is what we call the "mood breaker", no one has been able to acquire his contact information or residential location, but when you need him, just head to a bar and he'll be waiting for you... like he knew you needed him.<br><br>
                Either for small talk or a favor, he will always know what to do, but will refuse based on the difficulty and purpose.
                Don't get too cocky about what you want, or your favor will turn out to become your nightmare.<br><br><br>
                Why Old Fashioned? you might ask... You should not judge him based on the way he looks... but by his way of doing the job.
